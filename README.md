# 🚀 backend_ms

> A complete **microservices backend ecosystem** built with **Spring Boot**, **Apache Kafka**, **Eureka**, and a full **DevOps pipeline** — featuring CI/CD, code quality, observability, and service orchestration.

---

## 🎓 Project Overview

**backend_ms** is an ambitious academic project that simulates a real-world backend architecture based on **microservices**. It demonstrates how multiple services can work together using modern tools and best practices in cloud-native backend development and DevOps.

This project provides a hands-on example of building, deploying, and monitoring distributed services with high cohesion and scalability.

## 🧩 Architecture Highlights

- 🧱 **Modular Microservices**: Auth, User, Product, Notification, etc.
- 📡 **Kafka-based Event Bus**: Handles messaging between services asynchronously.
- 🧭 **Eureka Discovery Server**: Enables service registration and discovery.
- 🌐 **API Gateway**: Central access point for all client requests.
- 🔐 **Security**: JWT-based authentication across services.
- 📊 **Observability**: Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring all metrics.
- ⚙️ **DevOps**: Jenkins pipelines for CI/CD and SonarQube integration for quality gates.
